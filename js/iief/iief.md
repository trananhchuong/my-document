>## IIFE *(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)*
### What is it?
- Is a function/expression that is called/executed immediately
- Should add a ";" at the beginning of the IIFE expression to avoid the error
- Its scope is "private", so it helps to encapsulate the function/library without having the same variable name
